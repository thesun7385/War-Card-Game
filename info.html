            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The history of the War card game is quite ambiguous. Some believe that War is originally developed from a traditional card game called "Beggar-My-Neighbour." The game itself is simple to play, and the rules are easy to understand. This is why War is popular among kids and teenagers.</p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>To play the War card game, both players require a standard 52-card deck. One player shuffles the cards and deals them evenly to both players, face down. Players reveal the top card of the deck to start a round.</p>
            <p>Here's how the game works:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Each player reveals the top card of the deck and places it face-up in the middle of the table.</li>
                <li>Compare the ranks of the cards. The player with the higher-ranked card wins the round.

                </li>
                <li>If the cards have the same rank, a "war" occurs. Players place three cards face down and one card face up. The player with the higher-ranked face-up card collects all the cards.</li>
                <li>The game continues until one player runs out of cards. The player with all the cards wins.</li>
            </ol>
